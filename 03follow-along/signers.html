        <h1>Who Were the Signers</h1>
        <h2>Famous Signers</h2>
        <p>Some of the most famous signers of the Declaration of Independence include:</p>


        <dl>
            <dt>Thomas Jefferson</dt>
            <dd>He was the principal author of the Declaration and one of its most prominent signers. As the third
                president of the United States, Jefferson became one of the central figures in American history.</dd>

            <dt>John Adams</dt>
            <dd>A strong advocate for independence, Adams played a key role in the Continental Congress and later became
                the second president of the United States. He worked closely with Jefferson and was a major voice in
                pushing for independence.</dd>

            <dt>Benjamin Franklin</dt>
            <dd>One of the Founding Fathers and a highly respected figure in American history, Franklin was a diplomat,
                inventor, and philosopher. His wisdom and leadership were crucial in securing foreign support during the
                Revolutionary War.</dd>

            <dt>Samuel Adams</dt>
            <dd>Known for his fiery speeches and leadership in the Boston Tea Party, Samuel Adams was a key agitator for
                independence and one of the most passionate proponents of American liberty.</dd>

            <dt>John Hancock</dt>
            <dd>Famous for his large, bold signature, Hancock was the president of the Continental Congress at the time
                the Declaration was signed. His signature has since become synonymous with "signing" a document.</dd>

            <dt>Richard Henry Lee</dt>
            <dd>He introduced the resolution calling for independence in the Continental Congress, making him one of the
                most influential figures in the lead-up to the Declaration.</dd>

            <dt>Roger Sherman</dt>
            <dd>The only person to sign all four major founding documents of the United States (the Continental
                Association, the Declaration of Independence, the Articles of Confederation, and the U.S. Constitution),
                Sherman was a key figure in both the independence movement and the early government.</dd>

            <dt>Francis Lewis</dt>
            <dd>A signer from New York, Lewis was a wealthy merchant who suffered great personal losses during the war,
                with his home and property being destroyed by British forces.</dd>

            <dt>Lyman Hall</dt>
            <dd>A physician and a signer from Georgia, Hall played a significant role in his state's support for
                independence.</dd>

            <dt>James Wilson</dt>
            <dd>A prominent legal scholar from Pennsylvania, Wilson was one of the most influential signers and later
                helped draft the U.S. Constitution.</dd>
        </dl>
